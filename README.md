# Blood_Cancer_Tester
ðŸš€ This project uses machine learning (ML) to detect blood cancer based on a Kaggle dataset that I have found. 

ðŸš€ The model classifies blood cancer types to aid in early diagnosis, employing various algorithms for accuracy and performance evaluation.

ðŸš€ This model can detect or identify cancer sells from the blood accuritly and also able to graphically represent it. I have devidecd the dataset into 20 & 80 percents ratio to train and test the model.
